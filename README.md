# DataQuest-Projects

These are my solutions to the DataQuest projects as I complete the Data Engineer and Data Scientist paths. The aim is to apply the new skills I have learned as I move through the course's topics.

Projects include a variety of topics that are representative of practical data science problems. The data for each project is real data obtained from different repositories such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, World Bank and many more...

**Tools used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, SQL.
