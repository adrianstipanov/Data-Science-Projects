# Data Scientist Path - Projects

These are my solutions for the DataQuest projects as I complete Data Scientist path. The aim is to apply the new skills I have learned as I move through the course's topics.

Projects include a variety of topics that are representative of practical data science problems. The data for each project is real data obtained from different repositories such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, World Bank and many more...

**Tools used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, SQL.

### [Credit risk modeling – predicting loan defaults using ML](https://github.com/adrianstipanov/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Credit%20risk%20modeling%20%E2%80%93%20predicting%20loan%20defaults%20using%20ML.ipynb)


In this project we will focus on credit modelling by training a model to predict borrower's credit risk.

The dataset we'll be using is from Lending Club – a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. Lending Club releases data for all of the approved and declined loan applications periodically on their website.


### [Predicting House Sale Prices](https://github.com/adrianstipanov/Data-Scientist/blob/master/Predicting%20House%20Sale%20Prices.ipynb)

In this project we will work with [housing data](datasets/AmesHousing.tsv) for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. As a learning algorithm we will be using simple linear regression.


### [Predicting Car Prices](https://github.com/adrianstipanov/Data-Scientist/blob/master/Predicting%20Car%20Prices.ipynb)

The [dataset](datasets/imports-85.data) we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. For this purpose we will work with the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.

### [Analyzing NYC High School Data](https://github.com/adrianstipanov/Data-Scientist/blob/master/Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data.ipynb)

In this project we will investigate the correlations between SAT scores and demographics. For the purposes of this project, we'll be using [data](datasets/schools) about New York City public schools. 

### [Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates](https://github.com/adrianstipanov/Data-Scientist/blob/master/Storytelling%20Data%20Visualization%20on%20Exchange%20Rates.ipynb)

Our focus in this project will be on the exchange rate between the euro and the American dollar with a focus on explanatory data visualization. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020) we'll use describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021.

### [Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys](https://github.com/adrianstipanov/Data-Scientist/blob/master/Clean%20and%20Analyze%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys.ipynb)

In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

### [Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/adrianstipanov/Data-Scientist/blob/master/Star%20Wars%20Survey.ipynb)

Does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?
The team at FiveThirtyEight collected data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey.
In this project we will clean and explore the [dataset](datasets/star_wars.csv).

### [Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94](https://github.com/adrianstipanov/Data-Scientist/blob/master/Finding%20Heavy%20Traffic%20Indicators%20on%20I-94.ipynb)

The goal of this analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc.
John Hogue made the dataset available, and you can download it from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume)

### [Exploring eBay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/adrianstipanov/Data-Scientist/blob/master/Exploring%20eBay%20Car%20Sales%20Data.ipynb)

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the used car listings. The [dataset](datasets/autos.csv) of used cars is from from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.
